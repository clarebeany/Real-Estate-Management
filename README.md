Real Estate Management application being built for current our final 2 week capstone (due at graduation next Friday, 12/17). Created database connection and table, implemented GET property list & POST new property request via RESTful APIs. Utilized Vue for front-end. Still have refactoring to do and front-end design is still work in progress. 

Current functionality includes clicking search properties to display list of properties fetched from database, filtering the list, and adding a new property to the list. 

Features on the nav bar like register new user and logging in/out also work, however other nav features have yet to be built out (i.e. About).
